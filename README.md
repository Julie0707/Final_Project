Run movies_app.py in CMD, and then go to website http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on a browser. It is a welcome page of the “INSIGHT into Top 250 Movies” website. 

And users are asked to fill in the blank and choose options in the form based on their interest in movies’ information. Once submit the form, all the information collected here are used as criteria for filtering to get the personalized results of IMDB Top 250 Movies information in a page http://127.0.0.1:5000/handle_form/

There are two main parts of this app. The first is about classifying and sorting movies based on user’s preferred criteria. And the second is about choose two target name of any movies, directors, and actors to get the shortest path in the graph data structure. The second part can be skipped by the users.

Data structure: graphs, with movies’ title, actors and directors as nodes and their relationship as edges.
